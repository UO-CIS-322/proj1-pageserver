# README #

A "getting started" project for CIS 322, software engineering 1 at University of Oregon.

### What is this repository for? ###

* The objectives of this mini-project are:
  * Initial experience with GIT workflow:  Fork the project, make and test changes locally, commit;  turn in repository URL
  * Extend a tiny web server in Python, to check understanding of basic web architecture

### What do I need?  Where will it work? ###

* Designed for Unix, mostly interoperable on Linux (Ubuntu) or MacOS.  May also work on Windows, but no promises.  Consider creating a Linux virtual machine under Windows if you have trouble there, or just work on ix. 
* You will need Python version 3.4 or higher. 
* Designed to work in "user mode" (unprivileged).  Randomly chooses a port, so it could occasionally fail because the port is already in use.  

### Assignment ###
* Fork this repository to create your own repository on Github.  (Read the 'git' documentation as needed.) 
* Clone your repository onto the machine you want to work on.
* Make and test your changes
* Commit and push your changes to github
* Give repository access to the instructor (user MichalYoung on github)
* Turn in the URL to your repository so I can clone and test it for grading.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Maintained by Michal Young, michal@cs.uoregon.edu
* Use our Piazza group for questions. Make them public (anonymous or not as you prefer) unless you have a good reason to make them private, so that everyone benefits from answers and discussion.
